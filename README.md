# Threader

Threader is a static, client-side thread unfurler for Mastodon and Bluesky.

Paste a public post URL and it reconstructs the same-author reply chain into a clean reading view.

Optional: enable time-gap labels from the collapsed Advanced settings panel, or add `gaps` as a query param.

Optional: add `minimal` as a query param to hide chrome and render a content-only view.
